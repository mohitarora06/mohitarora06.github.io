A single hidden layer is used to classify the digits in the data set. Each pixel of an image is considered as the feature for the model. Weights for the hidden layer are learnt using back-propagation technique and regularization is implemented to avoid over fitting of the model. Accuracy of around **95%** is achieved.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
