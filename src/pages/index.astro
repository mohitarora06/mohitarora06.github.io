			<h1>üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Hello, Everyone!</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to my personal page! My name is <b>Mohit Arora</b>, and I am a passionate and driven software developer. 
				I have always been fascinated by technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems, and I am constantly striving to learn and 
				grow in my field.I have experience working with a wide range of programming languages, including Java, Python, C#, HCL, etc. and have worked
				on a variety of projects, from developing web applications to setting up infrastructure. I have experience with cloud-based technologies such as AWS and Azure.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of my strengths as a developer is my ability to work collaboratively with other team members, including designers, stakeholders, and
				fellow developers. I believe that effective communication and a willingness to listen and learn from others is key to the success of any project.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to my technical skills, I am also a problem-solver at heart, and am always looking for ways to streamline processes and 
				find more efficient solutions. I am passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the industry, and 
				enjoy attending conferences and meetups to network and learn from other developers.
			</p>	
			<p>
				When I'm not coding, you can find me gaming, reading, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. I believe that it's important
				to have a healthy work-life balance, and strive to make time for the things that bring me joy and relaxation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thank you for taking the time to visit my page, and I look forward to connecting with other like-minded developers in the future!
