      <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

      <p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>

      <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>
      <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
        <li>I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
        {identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && 
          <li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
        } 
      </ul>
      <p>My skills are:</p>
      <ul>
        {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
      </ul>
