<li><strong>Python Rolling</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>1) <a href="https://github.com/mohitarora06/Fun-Stuff-With-Python"><em><strong>Fun Stuff With Python</strong></em></a>:- Usage of Python, a scripting language to generate User Interactive applications. This include various games which require few of the Python libraries such as "SimpleGUI", which is written by professors of Rice University, to be loaded. These are fun single user games where scores are based on few defined rules. Click on one of the links below to go to the page. To play the full fledged user interactive games click on the run button on the left side</p>

</ul>

<p>1) <a href="https://github.com/mohitarora06/Hand-Written-Digit-Classification"><em><strong>Hand Written Digit Classification</strong></em></a>:- MNIST dataset of handwritten digits is classified using Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network. A single hidden layer is used to classify the digits in the data set. Each pixel of an image is considered as the feature for the model. Weights for the hidden layer are learnt using back-propagation technique and regularization is implemented to avoid over fitting of the model. Accuracy of around <strong>95%</strong> is achieved.</p>

<li><strong>DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>1) <a href="https://github.com/mohitarora06/Group-Messenger-2-"><strong><em>Group Messenger</em></strong></a> :- An "<strong>Android</strong>" application which provides Decentralized Ordering with Failure Handling. Total and FIFO ordering constraints are maintained throughout all AVDs present in the system which is the core of the application, provided without using any master slave technique. Along with it failure handling of the various nodes in the system is taken care by using a 3-way request response mechanism. </p>

<p>2) <a href="https://github.com/mohitarora06/SimpleDHT"><strong><em>Simple Distributed Hash Table</em></strong></a>:- Distributed Hash Table is based on CHORD which provide the 3 main functionalities of ID Space Partitioning, Ring Based Routing and Node Join. SHA-1, cryptographic hash function is at the core of this project which provides the basis for the routing of key value pairs in the system. Each node in the system knows about its predecessor as well as it successor to form a ring.  </p>

<p>3) <a href="https://github.com/mohitarora06/Replicated-Key-Value-Storage"><em><strong>Replicated Key Value Storage</strong></em></a> :- A simplified version of Amazon Dynamo is implemented to understand how "<strong>Dynamo Style</strong>" key value storage works. The main goal of this project is to provide both "<strong>Availability</strong>" and "<strong>Linearizability</strong>" at the same time. In other words, the implementation always perform read and write operations successfully even under failures. At the same time, a read operation always return the most recent value. Replicated storage is used to provide availability and Chain Replication technique is used to provide linearizability.</p>
