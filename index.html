<p>1) <a href="https://github.com/mohitarora06/Hand-Written-Digit-Classification"><em><strong>Hand Written Digit Classification</strong></em></a>:- MNIST dataset of handwritten digits is classified using Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network. A single hidden layer is used to classify the digits in the data set. Each pixel of an image is considered as the feature for the model. Weights for the hidden layer are learnt using back-propagation technique and regularization is implemented to avoid over fitting of the model. Accuracy of around <strong>95%</strong> is achieved.</p>

<li><strong>DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>1) <a href="https://github.com/mohitarora06/Group-Messenger-2-"><strong><em>Group Messenger</em></strong></a> :- An "<strong>Android</strong>" application which provides Decentralized Ordering with Failure Handling. Total and FIFO ordering constraints are maintained throughout all AVDs present in the system which is the core of the application, provided without using any master slave technique. Along with it failure handling of the various nodes in the system is taken care by using a 3-way request response mechanism. </p>

<p>2) <a href="https://github.com/mohitarora06/SimpleDHT"><strong><em>Simple Distributed Hash Table</em></strong></a>:- Distributed Hash Table is based on CHORD which provide the 3 main functionalities of ID Space Partitioning, Ring Based Routing and Node Join. SHA-1, cryptographic hash function is at the core of this project which provides the basis for the routing of key value pairs in the system. Each node in the system knows about its predecessor as well as it successor to form a ring.  </p>
